    "Data are monthly Nino3.4 sea surface temperature (SST) time series (a proxy for ENSO) from the\n",

    "You will analyze pre-industrial control runs that represent perpetual 1850 conditions  (i.e., they have constant 1850 climate). Data are munged (preprocessed) by the NCAR CVDP package (doi: 10.1002/2014EO490002, http://www2.cesm.ucar.edu/working_groups/CVC/cvdp//data-repository.html). Note: these are the same data from Homework 4 :) Remember??? \n",

    "Use this notebook to understand the different python functions that can be used to smooth data in the time domain.  Compare with a “by hand” convolution function.  Look at your data by printing its shape and also values.  Understand what the python function is doing, especially how it is treating edge effects."
